        Each inclusion uses java regular expression pattern matching, and must be separated by a new line. An empty 
        list implies that everything is included.

        Examples:<br/>
        <br/>
        <pre>
            myapp/src/main/web/.*\.html
            myapp/src/main/web/.*\.jpeg
            myapp/src/main/web/.*\.gif
        </pre>
        The example above illustrates that a build will only occur, if html/jpeg/gif files have been committed to the SCM.
